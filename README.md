# Google Cloud Function Course

## Starting a project
to start a new project in Google Cloud, we can go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) or we can create it from [Google Cloud Platform Link](https://console.cloud.google.com)

## Creating a Virtual Environment
First we have to install `python3-venv` with the following command
```
pip install python3-venv
```
Then we execute the following command
```
python -m venv venv
```
We activate the virtual enviroment using the following command
```
cd venv/Scripts/activate
```

In order to add new packages to our new virtual environment, we create a file called `requirements.txt` and execute the following command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
